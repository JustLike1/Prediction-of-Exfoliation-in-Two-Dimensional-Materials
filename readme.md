# no_sys.ipynb

Step 1: Use the no_sys.ipynb file to split the crystal structure into intra-layer and inter-layer components.
Modify the input_folder and output_folder in cells 5 and 6 accordingly.
# The no_sys_draw.ipynb file can be used to plot atomic density maps.

# processData_38_features.py processData_unlabeled_38_features.py

Step 2: Use processData_38_features.py to generate training dataset, and use processData_unlabeled_38_features.py to generate unlabeled prediction data.

processData_38_features.py:
Modify the negative sample path `fail_dir` and positive sample path `success_dir` within the `mian` function, along with the split directories `vasp_fail_dir` and `vasp_success_dir` from the `no_sys.ipynb` file.

# XGBoost_train.ipynb  XGBoost_predict.ipynb
Step 3: Use XGBoost_train.ipynb to train the model with cross-validation and evaluate its performance. Subsequently, use the entire dataset in the file XGBoost_predict.ipynb to predict the target structures.

XGBoost_train.ipynb:
Simply modify the file path parameter `csv_path`. The path to the CSV file generated by the `processData_38_features.py` script.
